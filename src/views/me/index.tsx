            I'm a web developer from China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³. I switched to tech after many
            years in sales. I have a strong passion for creating user-friendly
            and â™¿ accessible websites and web applications. My first tech job
            was working as a remote front-end developer for an Augmented Reality
            Studio in Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, where we develop our web app with HTML, CSS
            and vanilla Web Components. My second and current role is a remote
            WordPress Developer for an web agency located in Israel ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±.
